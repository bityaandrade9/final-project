            <p>My very first client project
            In November of 2019, I had a conversation with my former coworker in which I explained I was taking classes in graphic & web design.  After hearing this she was eager for me to make a logo for her start up business.  At first I was trying to decline because I had only understood the basics of digital designing but she insisted and encouraged me.  So I took on the task, she had provided me with the original drawing of what she wanted me to design, plus the colors, font etc. so that saved me plenty of brainstorming.  I used Adobe Illustrator for this task.
            Here is the original drawing:
